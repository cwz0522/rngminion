##rngminion

The rngminion.lua is a 4th gen emulator RNG script that hits your delay for you. This works even if you fast forward.

##requirements

* desmume 0.9.9
* runasdate (to force the date/time)

##todo
* Automatically advance frames with Chatots
* Type out detailed usage instructions
* Maybe support hitting date and time without relying on runasdate's time freeze
